CRUD allows users to take an enormous array of data (could be small too) and filter the data, change / update the data, and delete / isolate the data. 
CRUD makes data easily accessible to its users, while being relatively easy to use. 
Create, adds a new row in which you can populate with data, each column represents an attribute, and really only admins can add new attributes / columns. 
Read, Searches and filters data. 
A database of ice cream might enable users to type in "vanilla" or might provide options to filter search results by calories, year, intensity, and popularity. 
Update, is used to modify already existing records. 
To fully change a record you may have to modify information in multiple fields. 
Finally, Delete allows users to remove records from the database that are no longer needed. 
Hard deleting permanently removes the record. 
Soft deleting indicates that a row has been deleted but the data is still intact, removing it from being read, but still accessible or recoverable for or at later dates.
